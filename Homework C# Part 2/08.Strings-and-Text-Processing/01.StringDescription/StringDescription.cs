//In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant 
//or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and/or the length changed,
//or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally understood as a data type and is often implemented
//as an array of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character
//encoding. A string may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.

//Describe the strings in C#. What is typical for the string data type?
//Describe the most important methods of the String class.
