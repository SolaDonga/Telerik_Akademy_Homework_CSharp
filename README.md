##Homework C# Part One

####Introduction-to-PFamiliarize yourself with:
1. Create, compile and run a “Hello C#” console application.
2. Modify the application to print your name.
3. Write a program to print the numbers 1, 101 and 1001.
4. Create console application that prints your first and last name.
5. Create a console application that prints the current date and time.
6. Create a console application that calculates and prints the square of the number 12345.
7. Write a program that prints the first 10 members of the sequence: 2, -3, 4, -5, 6, -7, ...
8. Provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. How do they differ from C#?
9. Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework.
10. Write a program to read your age from the console and print how old you will be after 10 years.
 
####Primitive-Data-Types-and-Variables:
1. Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
2. Which of the following values can be assigned to a variable of type float and which to a variable of type double: 34.567839023, 12.345, 8923.1234857, 3456.091?
3. Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers with precision of 0.000001. Examples:
(5.3 ; 6.01)  false;  (5.00000001 ; 5.00000003) -> true
4. Declare an integer variable and assign it with the value 254 in hexadecimal format. Use Windows Calculator to find its hexadecimal representation.
5. Declare a character variable and assign it with the symbol that has Unicode code 72. Hint: first use the Windows Calculator to find the hexadecimal representation of 72.
6. Declare a boolean variable called isFemale and assign an appropriate value corresponding to your gender.
7. Declare two string variables and assign them with “Hello” and “World”. Declare an object variable and assign it with the concatenation of the first two variables (mind adding an interval). Declare a third string variable and initialize it with the value of the object variable (you should perform type casting).
8. Declare two string variables and assign them with following value...
9. Write a program that prints an isosceles triangle of 9 copyright symbols ©. Use Windows Character Map to find the Unicode code of the © symbol. Note: the © symbol may be displayed incorrectly.
10. A marketing firm wants to keep record of its employees. Each record would have the following characteristics – first name, family name, age, gender (m or f), ID number, unique employee number (27560000 to 27569999). Declare the variables needed to keep the information for a single employee using appropriate data types and descriptive names.
11. Declare  two integer variables and assign them with 5 and 10 and after that exchange their values.
12. Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints the entire ASCII table of characters on the console.
13. Create a program that assigns null values to an integer and to double variables. Try to print them on the console, try to add some values or the null literal to them and see the result.
14. A bank account has a holder name (first name, middle name and last name), available amount of money (balance), bank name, IBAN, BIC code and 3 credit card numbers associated with the account. Declare the variables needed to keep the information for a single bank account using the appropriate data types and descriptive names.

####Operators-Expressions-and-Statements
1. Write an expression that checks if given integer is odd or even.
2. Write a boolean expression that checks for given integer if it can be divided (without remainder) by 7 and 5 in the same time.
3. Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s area by given width and height.
4. Write an expression that checks for given integer if its third digit (right-to-left) is 7. E. g. 1732 -> true.
5. Write a boolean expression for finding if the bit 3 (counting from 0) of a given integer is 1 or 0.
6. Write an expression that checks if given point (x,  y) is within a circle K(O, 5).
7. Write an expression that checks if given positive integer number n (n ≤ 100) is prime. E.g. 37 is prime.
8. Write an expression that calculates trapezoid's area by given sides a and b and height h.
9. Write an expression that checks for given point (x, y) if it is within the circle K( (1,1), 3) and out of the rectangle R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2).
10. Write a boolean expression that returns if the bit at position p (counting from 0) in a given integer number v has value of 1. Example: v=5; p=1 -> false.
11. Write an expression that extracts from a given integer i the value of a given bit number b. Example: i=5; b=2  value=1.
12. We are given integer number n, value v (v=0 or 1) and a position p. Write a sequence of operators that modifies n to hold the value v at the position p from the binary representation of n.
	Example: n = 5 (00000101), p=3, v=1 -> 13 (00001101)
	n = 5 (00000101), p=2, v=0 -> 1 (00000001)
13. Write a program that exchanges bits 3, 4 and 5 with bits 24, 25 and 26 of given 32-bit unsigned integer.
14. *Write a program that exchanges bits {p, p+1, …, p+k-1) with bits {q, q+1, …, q+k-1} of given 32-bit unsigned integer.
